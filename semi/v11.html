  V-11 (1986)
</H1>
<P>
The V-11 (code name Scorpio) was DEC's first VAX microprocessor design, although
the second to ship. &nbsp;Bill Johnson was the project manager; Ed Burdick
was lead engineer on the IE chip, Bill Grundmann on the M chip; Dick Sites
led the architecture and microcode teams.
<P>
The Scorpio program aimed at launching DEC into the VLSI design era. In addition
V-11 itself, Scorpio encompassed a new CAD suite (CHAS) and DEC's first in-house
process development effort (and the industry's first double-metal process),
ZMOS. V-11 implemented a full VAX, with a robust memory and console system,
suitable for mid-range systems as well as embedded systems.
<P>
V-11 consisted of four chips, one of which could be replicated: the ROM/RAM
chip, the IE (instruction execution) chip, the M (memory management) chip,
and the F (floating point chip). Five copies of the ROM/RAM were required
to implement the full VAV instruction set. V-11 initially ran at 5Mhz, with
a high-speed bin point at 6.25Mhz.

V-11 shipped in early 1986 in the VAX 8200 and 8300 mid-range systems. By
that time, MicroVAX II had been out for more than six months and had captured
the attention of the company and the customer base. A mid-life kicker, the
VAX 8250 and 8350, based on binned parts, shipped in 1987.

  Personal Narrative
</H3>
<P>
V-11 attempted to do "six impossible things before breakfast" -- new methodology,
new CAD tools, new architecture, new process, new design team, new organization
-- and it paid the price for being a pioneer: a long development schedule
filled with mishaps. MicroVAX, by starting later and dropping much of the
complexity of the VAX architecture, reaped the benefits of V-11's (bitter)
experiences, pillaged its microarchitecture and design objects, and shipped
first. Yet V-11 fulfilled the intentions of its creators in revolutionizing
DEC's approach to chip design. Before V-11, DEC used partners for process
design, did its chip design work on paper, and had a small design group capable
of one design at a time. After V-11, DEC did its own process development,
did its chip design work entirely via CAD tools, and had a design group capable
of building multiple chips in parallel.
<P>
Once MicroVAX was on the drawing boards, the V-11 management team made a
determined effort to simplify the design and get it out the door. V-11's
unique F-chip was dropped in favor of a derivative of the J-11 FPA. Features
were stripped from the IE chip to get the size and power down. Even though
MicroVAX could be considered an internal competitor, the entire V-11 team
was extraordinarily gracious in providing support to the MicroVAX team.
<P>
I became the manager of microprocessor development in October, 1984, and
thus supervised the last 15 months of V-11. My only real contribution was
to utilize spare space in the control store patch RAM to recode CALLS and
CALLG for higher performance, based on studies done for CVAX.
<P>
V11 was presented at the 1984 International Solid State Circuits Conference.
