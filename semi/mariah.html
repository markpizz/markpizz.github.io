  Mariah (1990)
</H1>
<P>
Mariah (there never was an xVAX name) was an intermediate step between Rigel
and NVAX. Mostly a conversion of Rigel into CMOS3, it included two
new features: a redesigned cache chip that supported write back caching,
and support for the (new at the time) 32b physical memory ECO.
<P>
Starting with Mariah, my information on the microprocessor chips becomes
less detailed.
<P>
Mariah was implemented in DEC's 1u triple-metal CMOS process (CMOS3). Depending
on bin points, it ran at 62Mhz-71Mhz.

Mariah shipped in 1990 as an upgrade to VAX workstations and to the mid-range
VAX 6000 series. The low-end system group (VAX 4000) chose to skip
Mariah and go directly to NVAX.

  Personal Narrative
</H3>
<P>
While Mariah started on my watch as manager of the Microprocessor Group,
it finished under my successor's (Dan Casaletto). Mariah was intended to
stretch the life-time of the VAX 6000 by supporting write-back instead of
write-through caching, which would ease the burden on the main memory bus
(the XMI).
<P>
Mariah had a companion Advanced Development project, Mistral. The goal
of Mistral was to build a much higher speed version of Mariah by cooling
the chip-set to liquid nitrogen temperatures. The A/D team did pioneering
work on the process and system implications of super-cooling, only to find
that simply waiting for the next-generation chip produced an equivalent system
solution as quickly at lower investment.
