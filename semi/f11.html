  F-11 (1979)
</H1>
<P>
The F-11 (code name: the Fonz) was DEC's second microprocessor design, and
the first to be architected by DEC personnel. Duane Dickhut was the project
leader, Bill Johnson was lead design engineer for the Data chip, and Burt
Hashizume wrote most of the microcode. The MMU was designed by Dan Dobberpuhl's
consulting company.
<P>
The F-11 was substantially more ambitious than the LSI-11. It implemented
the entire PDP-11/34 architecture, including FP11-compatible floating point
and KT11-compatibile memory management. It targeted 3X the performance of
the LSI-11, at almost the same clock rate. It provided physical address extension
out to 22b, the first system to do so after the PDP-11/70. It implemented
the PDP-11 Commercial Instruction Set as an option; the only other implementation
was for the PDP-11/44.
<P>
Like the LSI-11, the F-11 was a chip set consisting of three designs, one
of which could be replicated: the Control Chip (up to nine supported), the
data chip, and the MMU chip. It was implemented in AMI's 6u NMOS process
and operated at 3.6Mhz (280ns microcycle).

The F-11, like its predecessor, was very successful. In addition to expanding
the penetration of PDP-11's in embedded and OEM markets, the F-11 was the
basis of the LSI-11/23 (Qbus) and PDP-11/24 (Unibus) family of systems. DEC
continued its tradition of second sourcing its designs by importing AMI's
technology into its semiconductor fabrication facility.

  Personal Narrative
</H3>
<P>
I joined Small Systems Engineering's chip team in late 1978, when the Storage
group I worked in transferred to Colorado Springs. For the first six months,
I worked as an individual contributor, writing a strategic position paper
on future chip directions and finishing half of the CIS microcode (the packed
instructions). The position paper recommended a design project to build one
more generation of PDP-11 microprocessors and an advanced development project
focused on building a VLSI VAX. This recommendation was accepted, and I became
the project leader for the last PDP-11 microprocessor, J-11.
