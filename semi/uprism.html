  MicroPrism (1988)
</H1>
<P>
Prism was the first RISC technology program at DEC to reach product development
status. MicroPrism was a CMOS microprocessor that implemented the Prism
architecture. Dan Dobberpuhl was the project leader; Rich Witek was the
architect.
<P>
MicroPrism was implemented in 1.5u double-metal CMOS (CMOS2) and operated
at 50Mhz-62Mhz.

    <TD>MicroPrism is a high performance RISC 32b microprocessor. Subject to
      date dependencies, the chip can issue one 32b instruction every 20ns cycle,
      achieving a peak performance of 50 MIPS for worst case process and operating
      conditions. Key features:

MicroPrism taped out in April, 1988. The entire Prism program was cancelled
in June, 1988. First pass parts were completed and were shown to be mostly
functional.

  Personal Narrative
</H3>
<P>
DEC made numerous attempts to investigate or build RISC systems. Among the
proposals prior to Prism were
<UL>
  <LI>
    SAFE (a 64b system that would run VMS, proposed by the Large Computer Group)
  <LI>
    Titan (a 32b system that ran Unix, prototyped by the Western Research Lab)
  <LI>
    Cascade (a 32b system proposed by Dave Cutler's DECWest team)
  <LI>
    HR32 (a 32b coprocessor proposed by the Dan Dobberpuhl and Rich Witek).
</UL>
<P>
In 1985, Jack Smith unified all the competing projects and named Dave Cutler
to lead the resulting program. Dave's team created a new architecture named
Prism. Prism was initially a 64b RISC system, but it was changed to a 32b
system with vector and 64b extensions, focused on technical computing. Prism
had a unified 64 entry register set. It included a concept called epicode
that implemented privileged operations in normal machine instructions.
<P>
Two CPU implementations were started: a mid-range ECL system called Crystal
(designed at DECWest) and a microprocessor called MicroPrism (designed by
Semiconductor Advanced Development). Dave Cutler's team was also designing
a new operating system to support Prism. This operating system offered some
degree of VMS application compatibility but was more focused on providing
a robust Unix environment.
<P>
From the outset, Prism was beset by difficulties. The two competing VAX ECL
system teams (Aquarius, later the VAX 9000, and Argonaut, later cancelled)
viewed Crystal as a competitor. The VMS and Ultrix groups viewed the proposed
new operating system with suspicion. MicroPrism had to compete for resources
with CVAX and Rigel. The closure of the architecture spec was delayed by
questions of 32b vs 64b, commercial versus technical focus, and so
on. As a result, the uPrism CPU was unable to start full implementation until
September, 1986. Work on an FPU (derived from the Rigel FPU) and cache controller
(derived from the Rigel Cache chip) was planned but interrupted by an edict,
in mid 1987, to make Prism a 64b architecture from the outset. This was rescinded
a few weeks later, and instead the Crystal systems project was cancelled.
MicroPrism, the only remaining hardware implementation, was directed to focus
on high-performance Unix workstations, but the project had been grievously
delayed. The team scrapped the cache controller and deferred the FPU in order
to concentrate on the CPU chip, which taped out in April, 1988, months behind
schedule.
<P>
Earlier in 1988, a group of workstation designers in DEC's Palo Alto office,
fed up with the delays, took matters into their own hands and decided to
build a Unix workstation around existing Mips chips, using the existing Ultrix
operating system. In 90 days, they produced a working prototype with a working
operating system. They then proposed that Prism be cancelled in favor of
using the Mips architecture. The rationale was that using the Mips chips
would allow DEC to field a UNIX RISC workstation by January, 1989; since
MicroPrism's FPU had just been started, using Prism would delay availability
by a year or more. The competing Mips and Prism proposals were evaluated
by the company's Executive Committee in June, 1988, and Prism was cancelled.
Dave Cutler left the company for Microsoft within a year. Dan Dobberpuhl
and Rich Witek left the Microprocessor Group to work in Advanced Development
(eventually on EV-4, the first Alpha).
<P>
I hadn't had much personal involvement with Prism, up until the very end.
Running the Microprocessor Group, writing VAX microcode, and trying to avoid
collateral damage from the VAX ECL system wars, had kept me busy. But as
part of the runup to the June Executive Committee meeting, I was asked to
evaluate the competing proposals. In a triumph of analytical purity over
common sense, I concluded that the Mips proposal would cost less and reach
the market sooner. For failing to back my own team in its moment of crisis,
I was barred from higher management roles in the Semiconductor Group. In
September, 1988, I was "promoted" from manager of the Microprocessor Group
to Technical Director of Semiconductor Engineering and leader of the Alpha
Program Office. I did not hold a line management job again for eight years.
<P>
MicroPrism was presented at the 1989 International Solid State Circuits
Conference.
