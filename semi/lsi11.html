  LSI-11 (1976)
</H1>
<P>
The LSI-11 was DEC's first microprocessor. A co-development with Western
Digital, the LSI-11's microarchitecture was designed by WD's Bill Roberts
(who later founded Emulex). Duane Dickhut wrote the microcode, and Rich Olsen
designed the module.
<P>
The LSI-11 broke with established PDP-11 precedents in several ways. The
PSW was not accessible as location 0177776; instead, two new instructions
(MFPS and MTPS) provided access. Floating point was done with a unique FIS
instruction set. The LSI-11 module abandoned the Unibus in favor of a simpler
structure, formally known as the LSI-11 bus but always referred to as the
Qbus.
<P>
The LSI-11 consisted of three chips, one of which could be replicated: the
microcode ROM (MICROM, up to three supported), the Control chip, and the
Data chip. It was implemented in Western Digital's 7u NMOS process and operated
at 3.3Mhz (300ns microcycle). Internally, the Data chip was an 8b microprocessor,
double pumping the data path to execute the PDP-11 16b instructions.

    <TD>The MICROM is a high speed 512 x 22b ROM which supplies microinstructions
      to the Data and Control chips under the direction of the Control chip. Up
      to four MICROMs are allowed in a system (DEC only used three). Two MICROM
      implement the base PDP-11 instruction set; a third is required to implement
      the extended (EIS) and floating (FIS) instruction sets.

Despite being the slowest PDP-11 ever produced, the LSI-11 was very successful,
particularly after the "double" sized (5.25" x 8.5") module was introduced.
Customers built LSI-11's into instruments, dropped them down oil wells, vaporized
them in furnaces, etc. The success of the LSI-11 as a volume product,
coupled with Western Digital's financial troubles in the late 70's, forced
DEC to become a second source manufacturer of the chip set. This was the
start of DEC's chip process development and manufacturing efforts, which
spanned twenty years.
