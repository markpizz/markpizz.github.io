  MPP (1987)
</H1>
<P>
MPP (Massively Parallel Processor) was an experimental, large-scale SIMD
(single instruction multiple data) parallel processor. It was targeted at
providing supercomputer levels of performance in array applications such
as simulation, fluid dynamics, and imaging. Built out of arrays of simple
4b processors coupled together by a scalable routing network, with a maximum
of 65,536 processors, MPP was a direct descendent of the Goodyear SIMD processor
and a predecessor to the Connection Machine.
<P>
MPP consisted of two chip types, both replicable: the MPP PE (processor element)
chip and the MPP Router chip. They were implemented in DEC's 2u double-metal
CMOS1 process and ran at 10Mhz.

  Personal Narrative
</H3>
<P>
As MicroVAX wound down towards release in late 1984, the team members began
developing other ideas. Dan Dobberpuhl and Rich Witek explored RISC technology.
Bob Grondalski, the memory management unit designer, became interested in
SIMD technology. By early 1985, he had an architecture for, and a performance
model of, a SIMD system implemented in VLSI CMOS that would perform at (gasp!)
10 gigaflops per second. Working essentially alone, he produced a behavioral
model for the core processing chip and went to the RAD Committee (an internal
funding source for risky new projects) for funding to continue the work.
The RAD Committee provided enough additional funds to hire a software developer,
and the project went forward. By the end of the year, Bob had finished the
logic, circuit, and layout design of both chips essentially single-handedly.
With part-time help from a layout designer, and after a short delay while
the fab's mask making facility was offline, the Router taped out in May,
1986, and the PE chip a month later. Both were functional, at speed, on first
pass. A second pass of the PE chip in early 1987 added additional features
and fixed a few bugs.
<P>
Lack of funding and resources delayed the system and software effort. A complete
miniature system, with 8 PE's and 3 Routers, was functional by mid 1987,
and a system with 64b PE's by September. At that point, the company decided
to license MPP to Jeff Kalb, formerly the VP of the VLSI Group, who had left
to do an MPP startup (MassPar). The decision was reversed at the end of the
year, but the entire project was stalled for more than 3 months; by the end
of 1987, only a 256 PE system had been assembled. The 512 PE system (16K
processors) was finished in March, 1988.
<P>
Thereafter, the project simply got lost in the company's processes. Although
approved for product development, changes in direction and competing claims
for resources prevented any serious MPP productization effort from getting
off the ground. The project simply faded away, and by 1989 the technology
had been shelved.
