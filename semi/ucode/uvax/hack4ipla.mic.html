.TOC	"	Introduction"

; This file is included in a separate assembly of the IPLA microcode.
; It causes "U space" to have a value so the .ULD file has a format of:
;
;		[addr]I=value
;
; for example:
;
;		[1000]I=0009D100E0500
;
; This is all so the IPLATEXT.PLI postprocessor works in converting
; the ULD file to a DECSIM MEM file.

.bin			; restore binary output
.UCODE			; set to U space
.WIDTH/5		; set width for next dummy microword
HACK4IPLA/=<4:0>	; define an unused macro
HACK4IPLA/2		; invoke it so there is some data in U space 
.ICODE			; switch back to I space
