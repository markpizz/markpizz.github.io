;	The specifier decode flows are entered to parse all specifiers in an
;	instruction before the instruction is executed (there is no separation
;	of first and subsequent specifiers ala MicroVAX and V-11).  They are
;	entered via the DECODER NEXT micro-order from the previous macro
;	instruction execution flow, or from the previous specifier flow.
;
;	There are four copies of each specifier flow, as follows:
;
;		AT = RMW,  Not indexed
;		AT = AV,   Not indexed
;		AT = RMW,  Indexed
;		AT = AV,   Indexed
;
;	There are 11 major entry points into the specifier flows, one of which is used
;	to process each specifier.  The entry points are:
;
;		Short literal
;		Index
;		Register
;		Register deferred
;		Auto decrement
;		Auto increment
;		Auto increment deferred
;		Displacement
;		Displacement deferred
;		Immediate
;		Absolute

;	Entry conditions:
;
;	IDR:		Contains zero-extended short literal data for short literal
;				mode,
;			Contains immediate data for immediate mode,
;			Contains address for absolute mode,
;			Contains sign-extended displacement for displacement and
;				displacement deferred modes,
;			Is unpredictable for all other modes.
;	Rn:		Register number of the specifier.
;	AT:		Access type of the specifier
;	DL:		Data length of the specifier.
;	Sn:		MD address of slot to use for this specifier.
;	PC:		PC after adjustment for the current specifier and extension.
;
;	Exit conditions:
;	VA:		Memory address for specifiers which reference memory.
;	Rn:		Register number of the specifier.
;	INT.RMODE<0>:	1 if the last specifier was a register, 0 otherwise.
;	STATE<2>	1 if the previous specifier was a .vx register specifier, 0 otherwise.
;	DL:		Data length of the specifier.
;	SC:		Shifted value of the logical index for an indexed specifier.



;					WARNING
;
;	A hardware restriction prohibits the microcode from using a CALL during
;	a cycle in which first cycle is asserted.  As the first specifier of
;	any instruction may be processed during first cycle, no CALLs should
;	be used in the microinstruction at a hardware dispatch entry in this
;	module.

.TOC	"	Short Literal (Modes 0-3)"


;	For this mode, AT=M, W, A, and V are illegal, as is an indexed short
;	literal.  There are separate dispatch addresses for AT=A, V and for
;	index, so the microcode explicitly generates a reserved addressing mode
;	fault in these cases.  The I-box checks for AT=M, W and generates a
;	microtrap in which the reserved addressing mode is forced.
;
;	At this point,
;		SN	=	MD address to use for this specifier
;		DL	=	Data length for specifier
;		IDR	=	Short literal in bits <5:0>, 0's in bits <31:6>

.TOC	"	Index (Mode 4)"


;	For this mode, the contents of the index register shifted left by the
;	amount indicated by DL is saved in a working registers.  The saved value
;	is then added to the base address at the end of the indexed specifier flows.
;
;	Because an index specifier can't be followed by another index specifier,
;	the microcode generates a reserved addressing mode fault in this case.
;	The I-box checks for XR=PC and generates a micro-address in which the
;	reserved addressing mode is forced.
;
;	At this point,
;		SN	=	MD address to use for this specifier

.TOC	"	Register (Mode 5)"


;	For this mode, the register data gets copied to an MD register.
;
;	Because it is illegal to index a register mode specifier, those cases
;	generate a reserved addressing mode fault.  The I-box checks for AT=A
;	and generates a microtrap in which the reserved addressing mode is
;	forced.
;
;	The code for AT=A,V is more complex than it might seem in order to support
;	the field instructions and EDIV.
;
;	For the field instructions, the SRM says that
;
;		EXTV #0, #32, r0, (r0)+
;
;	must extract the value from r0 BEFORE the auto-increment.  As all the
;	specifiers are processed before the execution flow, that flow sees the
;	auto-incremented value of r0.  To compensate, the register-mode AV specifier
;	flow copies the values from the GPRs addressed by Rn and Rn+1 to the MDs
;	so that the execution flow has access to the unmodified value of the GPRs.
;
;	EDIV has two write destinations.  In this case, we turn the
;	next-to-last write specifier into the corresponding .vx specifier so that
;	the potential memory address is left in the MD.  If that specifier is
;	register-mode, we store the register number plus one (Rn+1) into MD+1
;	so that the execution flow has access to the register number to which to
;	store the result.
;
;	The register-mode AV code assumes that it is processing a field instruction
;	and copies the GPR addressed by Rn to the MD.  It then increments Rn
;	and does a case on DL for the specifier.  By pure chance (or clever
;	layout of the specifiers, your choice), all field instruction have DL=B
;	and EDIV has DL=L for .vx specifiers.  This allows the microcode
;	to case on one bit of DL.  For field instructions, the GPR addressed
;	by Rn+1 is copied to MD+1 and Rn is decremented.  For EDIV,
;	Rn+1 (not Rn!!!) is copied to MD+1 and Rn is decremented.  The execution
;	flow for EDIV takes care of compensating for the off-by-one
;	register number.

;	Here if DL=Q.  PC was incremented by 8 to step past the quad immediate.
;	The address of the second longword of the quadword must be explicitly read
;	by the E-box, and is at (PC-8)+4 = PC-4.
;
;	The memory reference below intentionally does not use an AT-dependent command
;	because that would result in an implicit F-chip operand transfer.  The F-chip
;	only looks at operand alignment for the first transfer of an operand, which
;	was the explicit aligned transfer above.  Therefore, an AT-dependent command,
;	which is likely to be unaligned, would cause the F-chip to get the wrong data
;	for the second longword of the quadword.  To solve this problem, we do the
;	memory read into MD.TMP, and then copy the data to the appropriate MD, along
;	with sending it to the F-chip with an explicit, aligned transfer.  This
;	costs 1 microword and 2 cycles for all quad immediates.
