; Edit	  Date	 Who	     Description
; ---- --------- ---	---------------------
;    6 19-Apr-90 REC	Set edit to 6;
;			pass 6 code freeze.
;
;                REC	Pass 6 changes:
;
;	CSTRING (2)	Touch MD4 before exit in MOVC5 for srclen = dstlen = 0,
;			and in CMPC5 for src1len = src2len = 0
;
;
;    5 08-Nov-89 REC	Set edit to 5;
;			pass 5 code freeze.
;
;                REC	Pass 5 changes:
;
;	MEMMGT (7)	Fix MM.IB.FAULT.., replace d-read with case on
;			probe status
;
;	SELFTEST (8)	Convert 6 spare microwords for MM.IB.FAULT.. fix
;
;	INTLOGADR (4)	Flush write buffers in ADAWI.R.. to implement
;			NUDGE and BARRIER instructions.
;
;
;    4 09-May-89 REC	Set edit to 4;
;			pass 4 code freeze.
;
;                REC	Pass 4 changes:
;
;	IBOX (4)	Deoptimized MUL{B,W}2 and MUL{B,W,L}3
;
;	MULDIV	(4)	Deoptimize MULx2 and MULx3 and add a nop to the first
;			cycle of both execution flows to guarantee that we
;			get the correct value of DL for case branching.
;
;	POWERUP (3)	Constrain microword to former spare uaddr 6A8 to
;			allow a patch at SPEC.AV.REG..
;
;	SELFTEST (7)	Convert 1 spare microword to SPEC.AV.REG.DISPATCH
;
;	SPECIFIER (3)	Add a nop to the first cycle of SPEC.AV.REG..
;			to guarantee that we get the correct value of
;			DL for case branching.
;
;
;    3 28-Mar-89 REC	Set edit to 3;
;			pass 3 code freeze.
;
;                REC	Pass 3 changes:
;
;	INTEXC	(3)	Restore PC from BPC on halt interrupt
;
;	SELFTEST (6)	Convert 1 spare microword to IE.BACKUP.PC
;		 (5)	Separated Rigel and Mariah modules
;
;
;    2 30-Aug-88 REC	Cleared development flag, set edit to 2;
;			pass 2 code freeze.
;                GMU/
;		 RMS	Pass 2 changes:
;
;	CTRL	(2)	Added restriction about .vx specifier operands.
;
;	DEFINE	(3)	Added ASTLVL comments, SID option byte for VM.
;		(2)	Added conditional definitions for Mariah.
;
;	EMULATE	(3)	Added restriction about .vx specifier operands for
;			CVTPL.
;		(2)	Modified to use new physical mreq macros.
;
;	IBOX	(3)	Changed the first specifier of PROBEVMx from .rb
;			to .rl to reflect the recent VAX ECO.
;		(2)	Deoptimized MULL2.  The I-box does not guarantee
;			the state of AT for an optimized execution flow and
;			the operand transfer done at MULL2.R.. was being
;			killed by the M-box because AT was being set to
;			AT=A.
;
;	INTEXC	(2)	Modified to use new physical mreq macros.
;
;	INTLOGADR (3)	Changed CVTBI.R to use opcode case rather than
;			a DL case.  This avoids using a DL case in an
;			optimized entry point.
;		(2)	Added restriction about .vx specifier operations.
;
;	MACRO	(3)	Revised SCB macros to do physical references per VAXB ECO.
;		(2)	Added conditional macros for Mariah.
;
;    	MEMMGT	(5)	Replace MD.MMGT with TRAP in MM.IB.ERROR..
;    		(4)	Insert 2 cycles at the start of MM.IB.ERROR.. to
;			prevent PC <-- BACKUP PC violation.
;		(3)	Corrected radix on cross-page offset, updated
;			comments.
;		(2)	Modified to use new physical mreq macros.
;
;	MULDIV	(3)	Added restriction about .vx specifier operands.
;		(2)	Removed FPU& macro from the MULX2.R.. entry point to
;			reflect the fact that MULL2 has been deoptimized.
;			Only MULB2 and MULW2 enter thru MULX2.R..; MULL2
;			always enters thru MULX2.. after passing thru the
;			specifier flows where the second operand is transferrred
;			to the F-chip.
;
;	OPSYS	(3)	Added VINTSR to list of EPRs.
;		(2)	Modified to use new physical mreq macros.
;
;	POWERUP	(2)	Editorial changes for VM option.
;
;    	SELFTEST (4)	Removed two spare microwords for use in MM.IB.ERROR..
;		(3)	Removed spare microword for use in VECTOR.MIC.
;		(2)	Added conditional assembly to remove microwords
;			for Mariah variant.
;
;	SPECIFIER (2)	Added notes about DL case restriction in SPEC.AV.REG
;			flow.
;
;	VECTOR	(3)	Checked for vector disabled condition on exit from
;			MFVP.  This is necessary because SYNC and MSYNC must
;			force a vector unit disabled fault on the current
;			instruction rather than the next if a previous
;			vector instruction encountered an exception.
;		 (2)	Corrected the order of the ALIGNLIST at VEC.SYNCHRONOUS.
;			The error caused the current mode encoding to be
;			reversed for exec and supervisor modes in memory
;			reference instructions sent to the vector unit.
;
;	VFIELD	(2)	Added restriction about .vx specifier operands.
;
;
; (3)1 23-Aug-87 GMU	Cleared development flag, reset edit to 1;
;			pass 1 code freeze.
;
;    6 28-Jul-87 GMU	Included final vector interface.
;    5 13-May-87 GMU	Included error recovery features.
;    4 11-Mar-87 GMU	Included write even/odd parity functions.
;    3 17-Dec-86 GMU	Completed code for the six new string instructions.
;    2 14-Nov-86 GMU	Removed ACB{F,D,G}, add CMPC{3,5}, LOCC, SKPC, SCANC,
;			SPANC, optimize MUL{B,W,L}{2,3}.
; (2)1 12-Sep-86 GMU	Initial production microcode.
.TOC	"	Definition for Microcode Revision Number"


;	The constant MICROCODE.REVISION is the number returned in bits
;	<7:0> of the SID IPR.  At present, this constant is defined as having
;	the following fields:
;
;		 07 06 05 04 03 02 01
;		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
;		|DP|    Edit Number  |
;		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
;
;	where:
;
;		DP		= Development/Production flag:
;					0 = Production microcode.
;					1 = Development microcode.
;		Edit Number	= Edit number of the microcode.
;
;	For development microcode, the edit number should be incremented any
;	time a change is made that requires a corresponding model change.
;
;	For production microcode, the edit number should be incremented
;	when any change is made to the microcode.


;	Define the two parts of the microcode revision number.

.SET/MICROCODE.DP.FLAG=0		; development/production flag

.SET/MICROCODE.EDIT.NUMBER=6		; microcode edit number


;	Post-process into the final value

.SET/MICROCODE.REVISION=<.OR[	<.SHIFT[<MICROCODE.DP.FLAG>,7]>,
				<MICROCODE.EDIT.NUMBER>		]>
