  Introduction
</H2>
<P>
DEC began working in semiconductor technology in the early 1970's, when it
collaborated with Western Digital on one of the first 16b microprocessors,
the LSI-11. From that modest start, semiconductor-related projects grew to
encompass chip design, CAD tool engineering, process technology, and silicon
manufacturing and test. In 1979, all of the groups working in semiconductors
moved to a new, state-of-the-art facility in Hudson, Massachusetts. In 1981,
the groups were unified into a single organizational structure, first known
as the VLSI Group, then the Semiconductor Group, and finally as Digital
Semiconductor. The group operated as an integrated engineering/manufacturing
business until 1996, when the manufacturing and non-microprocessor design
teams were sold to Intel. In 2000, all the microprocessor design teams were
sold to Intel, bringing the three-decade history of Digital Semiconductor
to an end.

I joined the semiconductor design group (then known as CSD/LSI, I believe)
in 1978, as a strategic analyst. Over the next twelve years, I worked as
project manager of the J-11 (1979-1981), group manager of Advanced Development
(1981-1984) and project manager of MicroVAX II (1982-1984), group manager
of Microprocessor Development (1984-1988), Technical Director (1988-1990),
and Alpha Program Manager (1988-1992). I left in 1990, when the Alpha Program
was transferred from the Semiconductor Group to the VMS Systems Group. These
twelve years were the happiest and most productive of my career at DEC. I
worked with some of the best engineers in the business. I had the opportunity
to shape, manage, and contribute to the highly successful VAX microprocessor
series: MicroVAX II, CVAX, Rigel, and NVAX.
