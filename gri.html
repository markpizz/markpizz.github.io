  GRI-909 Simulator Configuration
</H1>
<P>
Introduced in 1969, the GRI-909 was the first system from the newly formed
GRI Computer Corporation. Targetted for embedded and process control
applications, the machine was very spare, with only one instruction format.
The GRI-99 was a follow-on product with expanded capabilities (notably an
index register). There was a third model, the GRI-919, but no documentation
on it has been found yet. Documentation on peripherals (such as the line
printer and disk) has also proved elusive.
